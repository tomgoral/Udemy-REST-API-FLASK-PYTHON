To install and cofigure Nginx on your server, follow the following instructions.

First, you need to update your server by running

sudo apt-get update
To install Nginx, run

sudo apt-get install nginx 
Allow Nginx access through firewall (otherwise incoming requests will be blocked by the firewall)

sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
Also since we have enabled firewall, remember to allow ssh through the firewall, else you will get locked out of the server.

sudo ufw allow ssh
You can check firewall status by using

sudo ufw status
To check Nginx status, use

systemctl status nginx
The following commands stop, start and restart Nginx respectively.

systemctl stop nginx
systemctl start nginx
systemctl restart nginx
Configuring Nginx
Create a new file for the items REST API configuration.

sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/items-rest.conf
Press "i" key (insert mode), copy and paste the following to the file

server {
	listen 80;
	real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;
	set_real_ip_from 127.0.0.1;
	server_name localhost;

	location / {
		include uwsgi_params;
		uwsgi_pass unix:/var/www/html/items-rest/socket.sock;
		uwsgi_modifier1 30;
	}

	error_page 404 /404.html;
	location = 404.html {
		root /usr/share/nginx/html;
	}

	error_page 500 502  503 504 50x.html;
	location = /50x.html {
		root /usr/share/nginx/html;
	}
}
After writing and quiting the file (escape key then :wq enter) enable the configuration by running

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/items-rest.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
Create the socket.sock file and clone the items rest app
Create a directory/folder for the app

sudo mkdir /var/www/html/items-rest
Since the director was created with root user, give access to the unix user ("jose" in our case) by making the user the owner of the directory.

sudo chown jose:jose /var/www/html/items-rest
Got to the directory, clone the app and install dependencies. Run the following commands one by one in that order.

cd /var/www/html/items-rest
git clone https://github.com/schoolofcode-me/stores-rest-api.git .
mkdir log
sudo apt-get install python-pip python3-dev libpq-dev
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv --python=python3.5
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
